# SOAR-EDR-Project


## Objective

The goal of this project was to create my own detection and response tools and to create playbooks for automation. As a plus I got to familiarize myself with some EDR/SOAR tools like LimaCharlie and Tines. 

### Skills Learned



## Part 1
For the first part of this project, I created a playbook workflow and branstormed about what actions I wanted it to take. I wanted the playbook to send a slack message and an email with information about the detection.
